        <p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in the Fort Greene neighborhood of New York City's
          Brooklyn borough on February 17, 1963,to bank employee Deloris and equipment supervisor
          James R. Jordan Sr. He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow basketball player Larry
          Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn. James Jr. became
          command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in
          2006. In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.</p>

        <p>The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon
          (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not
          drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center. Trail Blazers general manager Stu
          Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan,
          in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. Citing
          Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North
          American professional sports history.</p>

        <p>As a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he
          averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the
          1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan
          later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his three
          seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.</p>

      <p>“I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take
        the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I
        succeed.”
